#Sales Prediction using Machine Learning
This project is focused on predicting sales using machine learning techniques in Python. The dataset used for this task is obtained from Kaggle and contains historical sales data along with various features such as product attributes, store information, and time-related variables.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Python (version 3.6 or above)
Spyder IDE (installed via Anaconda or standalone installation)
scikit-learn (installed via pip or conda)
pandas (installed via pip or conda)
numpy (installed via pip or conda)

Usage
Open the data_exploration.ipynb notebook to explore and analyze the dataset.
Next, proceed to the data_preprocessing.ipynb notebook to perform data preprocessing tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
After preprocessing, move on to the model_training.ipynb notebook. Here, you will build and train the sales prediction model using various machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions using the trained model.
